# DMC: Deep Multidimensional Clustering

This repository aims to provides items about deep multimensional clustering(DMC), such as datasets, typical training processes, evaluation protocol etc. 

## What is DMC?

Deep multimensional clustering targets at multiple non-redundant partitions of unlabeled images with power of deep architectures that model non-linear similarity between images along different axes. For instance, we can group the figures based on the object meaning, environment, shape, color, material etc. 

## Why DMC?

DMC can extract more visual information than a single clustering that cares only about semantic meaning. With the use of  DMC, many applications are benefited, such as image search, video search, video recommendation, etc.
